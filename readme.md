I decided to take this class because I have always been interested in web-design, however, I do not have any experience with HTML or CSS.  I am currently in the MSBA program (Master of Science in Business Analytics) and have been working with both R and Python.  I thought it would be very beneficial to also learn HTML and CSS as it is something I am interested in, and would be a good thing to add to my resume!

But what exactly is the internet?  It was interesting to learn that:

- Not a lot of people actually know what the internet and/or the world wide web is! (I wasn't the only one).
- "Surfing the web" is a term derived from the similarities between the world wide web and the ocean. (The ocean takes up such a vast expanse of the Earth, most of which is unknown to humans).
- The internet is an actual physical infrastructure created by humans, and not something that exists solely in the "clouds".
