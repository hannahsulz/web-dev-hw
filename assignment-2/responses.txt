- One way that data travels on the internet is through packets.  The data is
broken up into tiny bits carried in packets that then travel through routers.
The data may take different routes on the journey and are reassembled at the
final destination.

- A computer's IP address is a set of numbers that is essentially its "address"
so that if a message is sent to another computer, that computer recognizes the
origin address if a message needs to be sent back.  The DNS, or Domain Name System,
associates domain names with IP addresses and allows your computer to find the
IP addresses associated with certain websites so that it is able to connect to
its destination on the internet.

- Cookies are small files that are stored on a user's computer and store a small
amount of data specific to a client or website.

- The three basic parts of a URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, are the protocol,
 the domain name, and the path.  The protocol's purpose is to declare how the
 web browser should communicate with the web server (the most common being http).
 The domain name is a unique reference that identifies a website on the internet.
 Finally, the path typically refers to a file or directory on the web server.
